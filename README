This is a classic CRUD application, backed by a JDBC database. It demonstrates:

- Accessing a JDBC database, using JPA.
- Achieving, table pagination and CRUD forms.
- Integrating with a CSS framework (Twitter Bootstrap ).

Twitter Bootstrap requires a different form layout to the default one that the Play 2.0 form helper generates, so this application also provides an example of integrating a custom form input constructor.

Bing: I have ported the app to using Japid as the rendering engine. Please see the 

1. project/Build.scala
2. app/Global.java
3. app/controllers/Application.java and
4. the japidroot folder

to understand the integration of Japid with Play2.
