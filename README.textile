This is a classic CRUD application, backed by a JDBC database, rendered with Japid42 for play2. 

It demonstrates:

- Accessing a JDBC database, using JPA.
- Achieving, table pagination and CRUD forms.
- Integrating with a CSS framework (Twitter Bootstrap ).
- Rendering data in Japid. 

japid42 is hosted at:  http://github.com/branaway/japid42/issues

To run the sample, make sure you're using play 2.0.4.

1. git clone git://github.com/branaway/computer-japid.git
2. cd computer-japid
3. play run



History


2012.11.1
1. now referenced japid42 repo on github. There is no need to build japid locally. 

2012.10.26

Bing: I have ported the app to using Japid as the rendering engine. Please see the 

1. project/Build.scala
2. app/Global.java: to initialize the Japid and added customized error handlers 
3. app/controllers/Application.java and
4. the japidroot folder

to understand the integration of Japid with Play2.
